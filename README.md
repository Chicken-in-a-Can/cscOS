# cscOS
Arch-based distro. Senior year project  
It'll have custom configs, and some form of custom installer. Not too much direction right now, 
just want to make something I would legitimately use

## Releases
Github doesn't let me put a release over 2GB, so use the build script I created  
Just run: `./build`  
Don't run with `sudo` or `doas`
