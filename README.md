# cscOS
Arch-based distro. Senior year project  
It'll have custom configs, and some form of custom installer. Not too much direction right now, 
just want to make something I would legitimately use

## Releases
Github doesn't let me put a release over 2GB, so I'll create a build script soon. For now
just create a working directory and use archiso by yourself. Sorry.
